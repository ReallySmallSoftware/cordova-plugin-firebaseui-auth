# Contributing
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the licence specified in the LICENSE file
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same License that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/ReallySmallSoftware/cordova-plugin-firebaseui-auth/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/ReallySmallSoftware/cordova-plugin-firebaseui-auth/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code where appropriate
Make sure at the very least you provide the information in the [issue template](https://github.com/ReallySmallSoftware/cordova-plugin-firebaseui-auth/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
The coding style should match what is present in the code currently. Do not reformat entire files.
